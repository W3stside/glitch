# Facebook Messenger Bot - Hooked into Navitia

This project creates a Facebook Messenger bot, completely
mirroring the quickstart located in [Messenger Platform docs](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/messenger-platform/guides/quick-start).
^ thanks guys.

It's a public transport bot that returns next available times for various metro lines in Paris.

## Getting Started

  The `Verify Token` is a string you make up - it's just used to make sure it is your Facebook app that your server is interacting with. 

For more detailed setup instructions, see [Messenger Platform Quick Start](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/messenger-platform/guides/quick-start).
